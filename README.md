## üß© Overview

This code implements a **high-order compressible Navier‚ÄìStokes solver** for two-dimensional hypersonic boundary-layer flows in argon gas.  
It is designed for continuum and transition‚Äìcontinuum regimes (Kn ‚âà 0.1‚Äì10) and supports machine-learning-based transport and wall models for nonequilibrium effects.

### Key Features

- Fourth-order central-difference discretization for **viscous fluxes**
- Modified **Steger‚ÄìWarming flux-splitting scheme** for inviscid fluxes
- **Pseudo-time explicit Euler** advancement to steady state
- Convergence monitored via residual reduction criteria
- **Parallel execution** using MPI (supports both domain decomposition and batch-wise training)
- Iterative linear solvers for **steady adjoint equations**
- Coupled training of **ML-based anisotropic transport** and **wall distribution models**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Numerical Methods

The Navier‚ÄìStokes equations are solved in conservative form using:
- **Viscous fluxes:** fourth-order central-difference scheme  
- **Inviscid fluxes:** modified Steger‚ÄìWarming flux-splitting  
- **Time integration:** explicit Euler pseudo-time marching to steady state  
Residual convergence serves as the stopping criterion.

The solver supports both **direct flow computation** and **adjoint-based gradient evaluation** for model training.

## üß† Machine Learning Augmentations

The code allows embedding **neural network closures** within the PDE solver for:
- Anisotropic, trace-free viscosity and conductivity models
- Data-driven wall models based on **skewed-Gaussian velocity distribution functions**
- Adjoint-based optimization for parameter training using DSMC data

Parallel multi-Mach and multi-Knudsen training is supported via MPI gradient aggregation.
